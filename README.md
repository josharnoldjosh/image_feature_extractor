# Image Feature Extractor 

## What is it?

A python script that extracts image features from images within a directory. The image features can then be used for finding similar images. 

## Requirements

* Requires hickle
* Should use python2 (python3 may not work)

## Usage 

* Navigate to a directory that contains images
* Run `group_images.py` in that directory. It will recurse folders and create an `images` folder with all images copied and renamed in that directory
* Run `extract.py` to extract image features
